This project aims to develop a waste classification system using deep learning techniques. 
The system is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the base model as EfficientNetV2B1. 
The front-end application is created using React, which allows users to upload images or capture images using their webcam for classification.

Usage 
Open the React app in your browser.
Upload an image or capture an image using the webcam. 
Click on the "Predict" button to get the prediction.
The predicted waste category will be displayed on the screen.
